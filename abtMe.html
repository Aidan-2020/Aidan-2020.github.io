            <p class="content">I enjoy reading, my mom got me into reading as a kid. Read a few fiction series growing up, Percy Jackson included. Nowadays I do both fiction and nonfiction, mostly nonfiction. I would say my two most memorable books so far are Every Falling Star by Sungju Lee and The Choice by Edith Eger. Those are both nonfiction, which is my favorite kinda book, but the two most recent fiction books I remember reading were Maul Lockdown (Joe Schreiber) and Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell. Maybe sometime I will add my reading list here because there is a lot on it.</p>
